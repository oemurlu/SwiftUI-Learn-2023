# :sparkles: I Am Rich

This is an ID app built with SwiftUI. I used VStack and ZStack to build my app. I chose my background using color property and shaped my picture using .resizable, .aspectRatio, .frame, .clipShape, .and .overlay and I also added circle located around the photo. In addition, I benefited from Google Fonts and used Pacifico-Regular font type. Besides, I generated an InfoView struct and then extracted it to use in my app. I used it to build the phone number and the mail address and I seperated them each other by using divider.
